We can solve this problem using a minHeap 

We'll have a res variable 


we'll want to loop

we want to set up our minHeap such that it follows 
distance, x, y
minHeap.append(distance, x, y)


We'll be popping from our heap k times 
so we want our first values to be the distance to the origin 

while k > 0 
we'll pop distance, x, y from our minHeap
